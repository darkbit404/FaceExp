# FaceExp
## Facial Expression Recognition

The project **Facial Expression Recognition** aims to implement a robust solution to recognize seve different types of basic facial expressions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad and Surprise. The projects includes experiments done on custom CNN architecture and transfer learning through ResNet50 to compare their respective performances.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of 28,709 labeled images in training set and 7178 labeled images in the testing set. Replace the placeholder path for train and test folders if necessary.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and run the project.

### Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/darkbit404/FaceExp.git
```
### Navigate to the Project Directory
Use cd command in windows terminal or windows powershell to navigate to the project directory.
```bash
cd FaceExp
```
### Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run the project
Open the cloned repository in your preferred IDE (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, or PyCharm). Locate and open the **CNN model.ipynb** file for the CNN model and **transfer learning ResNet50.ipynb** for transfer learning model, and then execute the code cells to run the project.

## Outputs
Trained models: CNN model.h5 and....

Classification Reports: Printed for both the Random Forest and Neural Network approaches.
